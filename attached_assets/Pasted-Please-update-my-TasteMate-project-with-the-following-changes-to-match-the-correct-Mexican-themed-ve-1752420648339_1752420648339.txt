Please update my TasteMate project with the following changes to match the correct Mexican-themed version with proper UI/UX, layout order, animations, and component styles. I want this to look and feel like the original "old tastemate" design. This version is targeted at Mexican food discovery and should be production-ready.

🔧 VISUAL CHANGES
Logo Header

Center-align the TasteMate logo at the top.

Use the logo image I uploaded (logo.png or the one just above).

Make it larger and spin slowly on hover or tap.

Keep the language flags, dark mode toggle, and settings icon aligned to the top-right.

Promo Carousel

Place it right below the header.

Fix any broken promo image paths (replace them with local working PNGs if needed).

Component Order
Reorder components to this exact layout:

Header

Promo Carousel

Chatbot Intro Message — Text:
👋 Hi! I'm TasteMate, your flavor buddy, let me help you choose the perfect meal!

Text Input — Placeholder:
Tell me what you're craving...

Spiciness Meter

Label should say How Spicy? aligned to the left.

Levels: 0 (❄️), 1 (🌶️), 2 (🌶️🌶️), 3 (🌶️🌶️🌶️), 4 (🔥🌶️).

Glow animation increases with intensity.

Each pepper wiggles slightly on hover/touch.

This replaces the old 6-level meter with a 5-level one, so update database seeders and models accordingly.

Flavor Shortcut Buttons

Match the rounded teal buttons in the second image.

Animate subtly on hover/tap.

Each should still support hotkey display and translations.

Input Row

"Surprise Me" button and "Send" button should appear on the same row, aligned and centered under the flavor buttons.

Body Background

Use the uploaded background-bg.png file as the repeating or full-body background (whichever looks better).

It should be subtle and not interfere with readability.

🎨 THEME FIXES
Themes are currently prefixed with "themes" — remove the prefix so that class names reflect the actual theme (e.g., default, sunset, minty, etc.).

Fix theme switching logic so that the primary and secondary colors are applied globally (via Tailwind CSS or context provider).

Ensure admin CRUD for themes is working and now reflects corrected class structure.

🧠 DATABASE CHANGES
Spiciness levels are now 0–4 instead of 0–5:

Update the MongoDB Spiciness collection.

Adjust the seed data and frontend mapping logic accordingly.

Ensure any existing API endpoints like /api/spiciness return this updated structure.
